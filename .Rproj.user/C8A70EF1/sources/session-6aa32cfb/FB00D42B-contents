###  Pandemic and Stock Returns: The effects of COVID-19 on industry profitability and investor attitudes towards risk.

#                       Question 1

During a pandemic, essential sectors such as healthcare and technology supporting remote work which were in higher demand are likely to remain profitable.  In contrast, non-essential industries like hospitality and travel may suffer revenue losses due to restrictions and reduced consumer spending. Industries reliant on global supply chains may experience disruptions, affecting profitability and stock returns. During a pandemic, investors tend to favor safer assets like government bonds or gold, causing stock prices across industries to decrease.  Economic uncertainty and investor hesitancy can also disproportionately affect economically sensitive industries. Central bank policies may also impact industries differently based on interest rate and liquidity sensitivity and thus may affect investors decisions on the stock market.

                          labs(x = "Years", y = "Cumulative returns")



```

We can see from the graph that at the beginning of 2020 BusEq, Durbl,NoDur, Other, shop, money were doing pretty well but by the end of 2020, Durbl performed the most, followed by BusEq and shops.



```{r cars}
#                             Abnormal Returns
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
project_long <- project_long %>%
                group_by(industry) %>%
                mutate(abnorm_returns=average_returns-mkt) %>%
                mutate(cm_abnorm_returns=cumsum(abnorm_returns))

#                         Test of Means
# For entire industry
t.test(average_returns-mkt) #Test of means

# For each industry
t_test_results <- project_long %>%
  group_by(industry) %>%
  summarize(t_test_result = list(t.test(average_returns, mkt)))
print(t_test_results)
#library(knitr)
#kable(t_test_results)


```

The null hypothesis states that the difference in average daily returns and the market returns is equal to zero. The alternative hypothesis says the difference is not equal to zero. After comparing the p-values for the entire industry and the individual industry differences (abnormal returns), we fail to reject the null hypothesis true mean equal zero. We conclude that the difference in daily weighted average portfolio and the market portfolio (abnormal returns) are not statistically different from each other.

                       cm_abyr=mean(cm_abnorm_returns)) %>%
                      arrange(desc(sd))
                     
# visualization of the standard deviation by year (1 & 2)

                      facet_wrap(~Year) +
                      geom_text(aes(label = industry), vjust = -0.5, hjust = 1) +
                      labs(x = "industry", y = "standard devation")
                      

ggplot(data=sdtvs_avreturns, aes(Year, sd, group=industry,
                              color=industry)) + geom_point()



```

We can see from the first plot that in 2019 the Enrgy industry has the highest standard
deviation and thus will have a higher variance. This is followed by the Utils,  the Durbl, Teclcm, NoDur, Chems and Health. In 2020, the Enrgy industry still had a highest standard deviation, followed by Durbl, Uitls and Money. A quick observation here is that the money industry had a lower standard deviation in 2019 but became the 4th industry with higher variance in 2020. Generally, in 2020, all industries had standard deviation above the median standard deviation in 2019 which suggest the volatility of the industries during the Covid period. In 2021, Durbl industry had the highest standard deviation, followed by Enrgy, Utils and Telcm but see that the standard deviation of the industries are comparably smaller to that of 2020, signifying the change of events after covid.

```

The first three industries which were risk in 2019 are Energy, Utils and Durbl. In 2020, we can see that Energy had the lowest cumulative average returns, followed by Utils. Durbl industry, however, performed well despite its being risky in 2019.




```{r}
#                   4b
median(sd_2019$sd)
#0.5374457

project_long <- project_long %>%
                group_by(Year,industry) %>%
                mutate(sd=sd(abnorm_returns)) %>%
                mutate(safe_insutry_sd19=ifelse(sd<=0.5374457, "risky", "safe")) 

# Test of means   risky versus safe
attach(project_long)
t.test(cm_abnorm_returns~safe_insutry_sd19)

```
Comparing risky industries versus safe industry based on 2019 median standard devation,  we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the difference abnormal returns between  risky and safe industries is zero based on  p-value of 0.000 and conclude that there  is statistically significant difference between risky and safe industries during the Covid period.


```{r}
#                 4c
attach(sdtvs_avreturns)
sd_2020 <- sdtvs_avreturns[,c("industry", "sd")] %>%
  filter(Year==2020)

cm_abreturns_2021 <- sdtvs_avreturns[,c("industry", "cm_abyr")] %>%
                  filter(Year==2021)
sd_20cm_abreturn_21 <- sd_2020 %>% left_join(cm_abreturns_2021)

#              Scatter plots    
ggplot(sd_20cm_abreturn_21, aes(x=sd, y=cm_abyr,  color=industry)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = industry), vjust = -0.5, hjust = 1) +
  labs(x = "2020 Standard Deviation", y = "2021 cumulative Abnormal Returns", 
       title = "2021 cumulative Abnormal returns versus 2020 standard devations") +
  theme_minimal()



```
We see that industry that had lower standard deviation in 2020, for example, BusEq had a higher cumulative average returns in 2021 and similarly for industry like shop, health, Manuf. However, the Energy sector with higher standard deviation in 2020 had a lower cumulative average returns and similarly for Utils The only exception to this rule is Durbl which had a higher standard deviation and still had a higher abnormal returns.

```{r}
median(sd_2020$sd)
#0.8662986
project_long <- project_long %>%
                group_by(Year,industry) %>%
                mutate(sd=sd(abnorm_returns)) %>%
                mutate(safe_insutry_sd20=ifelse(sd<=0.8662986, "risky", "safe")) 

# Test of means   risky versus safe
attach(project_long)
t.test(cm_abnorm_returns~safe_insutry_sd20)


```

Comparing risky industries versus safe industry based on 2020 median standard deviation, we reject the null hypothesis that the difference in cumulative abnormal returns between risky and safe industries is zero based on p-value of 0.000 and conclude that there was statistically significant difference between risky and safe industries during the Covid period.


#                       Question 5
The prediction in (1) is consistent with question 2,3, and 4 in that we observe Durables (Cars, TVs, Furniture, Household Appliances) despite being classified as risky, this industry performed well in the phase of the Covid because people consumers demands Tvs and household appliances due to the lock down and also the need to own a car to prevent contracting covid from public transport services. Again, we see that the Manufacturing industry average daily returns and abnormal returns plenged and this can be attributed to supply changes disruptions.
